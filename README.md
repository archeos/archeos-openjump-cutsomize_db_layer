===================================

Just a simple script for OpenJUMP, to add a customized database schema into a new layer. The script was written by Luca Bezzi for Arc-Team in 2008.

To run the script, place it in your OpenJUMP BeanTools directory (e.g. /OpenJUMP-1.6.3-r3576-PLUS/lib/ext/BeanTools), than run OpenJUMP, go to Customize --> BeanTools and you should see a new command called arc-team_layer (if not, just click on the command RefreshScriptMenu and the new script should appear).

For discussion about possible modification of the schema, you can refer to the specific post in ATOR:
